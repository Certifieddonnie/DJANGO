This File includes what I am learning from the django tutorials.
==============================================

Created a poll app. in the views file, i created an index function. and added urls file in the app folder
For every function you create in the views file.
You add the function url to the urls file.
All Apps have a specific url added in the main project urls file.

In the app urls file. we have a function 'path' that contains 4 args.
the args are; route, view, kwargs, name.
The route app indicates the url pattern of where to access the view of that particular function.
in the project's url we have a general url pattern to access each app.
For example; In the polls app.
We added the polls url to the project's urls file. ["polls/"]
then in the polls url we include paths to the different functions created in views. ["index/"]
If we want to access it on the web. we check ["polls/index/"]

I have been able to include some templates.
Though still testing some few features. I included the templates folder in the settings,
changed the HTTPResponse to render in the views.py file. I applied some Jinja styles. 
i guess i will be dealing with more of Jinja.

I just finished learning how to add two numbers and making it reflect on my web.
i created a new html file call result and a base html file, that includes all i want to reflect on all my web pages
the home html hold the form to accept the two values. and the submit redirects it to the next url due to mapping
that's the result page. 
in the views file i included the add function that will hold the result of the addition in home page.
Finally got the output. Still going to work on the web output.

Our data needs to be protected. we use the post function of the http protocol to protect our data.
we included the csrf token to avoid hackers attacks.

so i was able to connect my pages together and include an image but isn't showing. 
still wondering?? Even though i added the load static command to my file. well i will figure it out tomorrow.
